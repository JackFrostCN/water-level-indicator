You'll need to create a circuit diagram showing how to connect the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to the PIC16F887 microcontroller and the 1602A LCD display. Below is a basic outline of the connections:

HC-SR04 Connections:

VCC to 5V
GND to GND
Trig to a GPIO pin of PIC16F887 (e.g., Pin 1)
Echo to another GPIO pin of PIC16F887 (e.g., Pin 2)
1602A LCD Connections:

VCC to 5V
GND to GND
RS to a GPIO pin of PIC16F887 (e.g., Pin 3)
RW to GND
EN to a GPIO pin of PIC16F887 (e.g., Pin 4)
D4, D5, D6, D7 to GPIO pins (e.g., Pin 5-8)
You can use a schematic drawing tool like Fritzing, Tinkercad, or Proteus to create a professional-looking schematic.
